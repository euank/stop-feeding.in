      <p>We are happy to announce the founding of the fictional Stop DOTA2 Feeding Foundation!</p>
      <p>The Stop DOTA2 Feeding Foundation is a new foundation which aims to help feeders and victims of feeders in DOTA2. <span>We are against feeding and other detrimental play in DOTA2 and want that everyone in DOTA2 plays well. Feeding in DOTA2 is a very serious issue and should be seen as that - it just does not belong there.</span></p>
      <p>We want to make this website a place where DOTA2 players can read up on feeding in DOTA2, how to prevent it and what one can do if another player is feeding. </p>
      <p>Stay tuned for further updates!</p>
