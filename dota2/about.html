  <h2>About the Stop DOTA2 Feeding Foundation</h2>
  <p>The Stop DOTA2 Feeding Foundation is a fictional foundation based in the mariana trench, which aims to help any people feeding in DOTA2.</p>
  <p>We are against feeding and other detrimental play in DOTA2 and want that everyone in DOTA2 plays well. <a title="What is feeding" href="what-is-feeding"><strong>Feeding in DOTA2</strong></a> is a <strong>very serious issue</strong> and should be seen as that - it just does not belong there.</p>
  <p>The foundation is funded by anonymous donors, of which some of them were DOTA2-feeders.</p>
  <p>Together we are strong and continue to fight any feeding in DOTA2.</p>
  <p>Spread the word of our humanitarian organisation and help raising awareness about feeding in DOTA2.</p>
